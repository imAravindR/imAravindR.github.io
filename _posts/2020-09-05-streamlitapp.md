Most people leave any service because of dissatisfaction with the way they are treated. They would not be looking around if they were happy with their current provider, its service and employees. [source](http://www.dbmarketing.com/telecom/churnreduction.html#:~:text=Industry%20retention%20surveys%20have%20shown,provider%2C%20its%20service%20and%20employees.)

Accenture reports that 77% of consumers are no longer as loyal to brands as they were even three years ago. Much like everyone else, the telecom industry must work harder than ever at customer retention. [source](https://acquire.io/blog/improve-customer-retention-in-telecom-industry/)
