# Bank Churn Prediction

Why Customer retention is important? [source](https://www.dcrstrategies.com/customer-incentives/5-reasons-customer-retention-business/)

    *1. Save Money On Marketing
    2. Repeat Purchases From Repeat Customers Means Repeat Profit
    3. Free Word-Of-Mouth Advertising
    4. Retained Customers Will Provide Valuable Feedback
    5. Previous Customers Will Pay Premium Prices.* 

Why and when will a customer leave his/her bank could be a challenging question to answer.

Here, we have a data from kaggle where all the historical information about a customer and whether he/she left the bank or not is available.

Our goal is to use the power of data science to help the bank identify those who are likely to leave the bank in future.

## Load Libraries 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
```

## Read Data

Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
